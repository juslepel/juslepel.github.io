            What am I doing at the HZ in Middelburg?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I was born in Leiderdorp and lived in the center of Leiden for most of my life. It's a city inbetween The Hague and Amsterdam.
            When it came time to decide what school I wanted to enroll at for my higher education, I decided that I did not want to stay there.
            Even though I love the city and would also be able to go to school in other cities nearby, like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, I decided that I'd rather go somewhere else.
          
            First of all, I preferred a smaller school. In my area there are mostly large schools, while I personally would rather go to a medium-sized type of school.
            This meant that a lot of the schools nearby were ruled out, and the schools that were left after that did not have a good reputation.
            I would love to say it's just a bad reputation that won't have to mean anything, but with the encounters I've had with teachers and representatives from the school, those bad stories just became more believable instead of proving me wrong.
            Thus, I was not interested in the slightest in the schools nearby. The other reason I decided to look for a school somewhere else, was the housing situation.
            Even though it can be difficult to find a place anywhere in the country, the area where I lived is probably one of the most difficult. It's in the randstad, and besides that, there's a big student population there, too.
            I knew that finding housing eventually there would be nearly impossible, and I did not think the schools there were worth the struggle anyways, so I decided to look for another city, further away.
            With a lot of researching I came across the HZ. I ended up with a list. 
            <ul class="faq">
              <li>Arnhem</li>
              <li>Zwolle</li>
              <li>Middelburg</li>
              <li>Den Bosch</li>
              <li>Ede</li>
            </ul>
            
            Then came time for the decision making. Not only for the school, but also to decide the place I would have to move to and live for atleast the years it would take me to complete their program.
            I ended up ruling out Den Bosch first, as I wasn't a fan of the city at all. Next I crossed out Ede, as I know the area and school very well.
            Even though I love the area around it, I know a lot of people that went to the school and even someone that was involved with setting up the ICT study program there, and with their opinion on the school, it did not seem like the place for me.
            After this it was between Zwolle, Arnhem and Middelburg. Anyone who knows me will confirm I am very indecisive and will avoid decisionmaking altogether if I can, which I sadly couldn't in this case.
            They all had their pros and cons.
