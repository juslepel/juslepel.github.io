          <h2>Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
          <h5><em>My personal SWOT analysis, sept 14, 2023</em></h5>
          <p><b>What are your strong points?</b>
            <br>
            I am good at and enjoy tasks and assignments with a specific goal. Besides that I think for myself a lot,
            and am good at staying calm in busy and stressful situations
          </p>
          <p><b>Wat are your weakpoints?</b>
            <br>
            I can struggle with communicating and understanding others in situations where they have a different
            thoughtprocess from me.
            This is something I am aware of cause I tend to approach some things in different ways than others. I try to
            be mindful of this and focus on the way other's have interpreted sentences, but sometimes I forget this and
            there ends up being a lot of confusion and miscommunication.
            It's difficult for me to change the way I approach and think about things, but when I stay aware of it, I
            have noticed things going a lot smoother.
          </p>
          <p><b>Which opportunities do you see?</b>
            <br>
            An opportunity for me at this school would be getting to know other people with similar interests. I also
            think it's a big opportunity for me to practice with planning, as I am very bad at planning and tend to not
            be motivated enough.
            I end up staring at and overthinking the subject, instead of actually starting it and going through the
            steps. This makes for a lot of panic and urgency in the last moment.
          </p>
          <p><b>Which risks do you see?</b>
            <br>
            I moved to a different part of the country, so I now have to adjust to living on my own, getting to know
            everything here, and staying in contact with my friends and family.
            I think another threat for me would be that I can struggle with deadlines. Once they are stacking up and I
            am behind, I tend to avoid the problem instead of doing something about it and taking action. This is
            connected to another threat of mine; I can become quite afraid of failure.
            Instead of perfectionism, this causes me to not try at all. It's hard for me to put a lot of effort into
            something if I might fail. If the risk is very big I tend to not do anything for it, since "If I didn't try,
            I can't have failed it".
            I am scared of trying my hardest and eventually being confronted with the fact that, even though I tried my
            hardest and put in so much tie and effort, I still failed.
