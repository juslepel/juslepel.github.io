          <h2>Study choice</h2>
          <h5><em>My study choice, sept 14, 2023</em></h5>
          <p><b>Study choice activities</b>
            <br>
            I went to multiple open viewing days, in which I mainly looked at technical studies and studies in the ICT field (electrical engineering, systems embedded engineering, ICT, automotive). I also talked with friends and family about my choice and what would fit me.
          </p>
          <p><b>Motivate your studychoice</b>
            <br>
          I decided on ICT, because I've had interests in similar subjects surrounding it, for a long time. For example the hardware of pc's, but I also really enjoy keyboards. In my free time love learning more about the working of keyboards; I built my own keyboard barebone, but am planning to build up my own, putting together, soldering and configuring the controller myself. I love finding out more about the subject and whenever a subject related to it is brought up I always want to join or listen in on the conversation. 
          I looked through the studies more focused on the hardware of ICT, but eventually this study seemed to be the best fit for me.</p>
          <p><b>After completing the study..</b>
            <br>
          I still don't know what I want to do with this study course. I think the technical side of it fits me better than the business side of things. I hope in 4 years I will know the way around the ICT environment, will have larned things and gained the skills to figure out and find my way in the things that haven't been touched on in the study course.</p>
