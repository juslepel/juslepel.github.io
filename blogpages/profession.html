          <h5><em>company safari, oct 3, 2023</em></h5>
          <h3>Citrine informatics</h3>
          <p>
            Citrine informatics is a SaaS platform company that uses AI and materials science so that their customers
            can improve product development and optimization. The platform can be used to store and look at product
            information, the materials and all other steps into making the product.
            <br>
            They currently have openings for a software engineer for the frontend, and for a data and artificial
            intelligence research engineer. As their software engineer you create web applications to enable user
            interaction with the machine learning models.
            The job requires JavaScript and/or typescript experience, and would be remote. The company seems to focus on
            equality and inclusivity inside the company.
            <br>
            I don't see myself working there right now, as from that I gathered, working with this company would require
            you to live anywhere in the US; its a remote position, b√∫t within the US. It's also a senior position with a
            lot of data science involved. As stated in my motivation, data is not an area I would be interested in.

          <h3>Centre for Human Drug Research</h3>
          <p>
            The Centre for Human Drug Research tests new drug treatments, in particular for Central Nervous Systems. The
            company develops new methods to test, and collect and evaluate data for, these new drug methods.
            The company is currently developing a portable version of an already existing inhouse testing platform.
            <br>
            As a medior software engineer at this company, you will be designing and implementing the software solution
            for this project.
            The company asks for experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML and Agile development methods, together with
            general experience in the field and experience in architecture and design of cloudbased/hybrid software. The
            company describes itself as a pleasant workspace with an open work environment.
            <br>
            The environment definitely interests me. Healthcare has always interested me, I've even considered a nursing
            HBO study in the past. Even though you're not directly doing anything medical, you are contributing to it
            and connected to it. My parents have both had similar jobs, being in the healthcare field but not "at the
            front line".

          <h3>QuTech</h3>
          <p>
            QuTech is a research institute at the TU Delft. They're located on the campus of the university, as well.
            They develope prototypes of a quantum computer and secure quantum internet. As a software engineer here you
            will be part of the Software Development Support team.
            The job entails maintaining the institute's software, and providing technical and non-technical support on
            software development. The position requires experience with both Windows and Linux, fluency in
            object-oriented programming, and a variety of other requests.
            <br>
            This would be a hybrid job, so time would be divided between home and the TU Delft campus. The team you
            would be a part of consist of 2-3 other people.
            <br>
            It seems interesting to work at a research centre. They also focus a lot on the fact that they are part of
            the university. Out of the 3 companies, I think that this opening and company would fit with me most.
